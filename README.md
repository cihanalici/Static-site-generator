# Static-site-generator

A static site generator takes raw content files (like Markdown and images) and turns them into a static website of HTML and CSS files. Static sites are quite popular for blogs and other content-heavy websites because they're lightning-fast, secure, and easy to host.

## Why use a static site generator?

- **Speed**: Static sites are fast because they don't need to query a database or run server-side code. They're just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that can be served directly to the browser.

## PRE-REQUISITES

- **Git**: You'll need Git to clone the repository and manage your site's content.
- **GitHub account**: You'll need a GitHub account to host your site with GitHub Pages.
- **Python 3.11+**: You'll need Python to run the static site generator.
- **Unix-like OS**: The static site generator is designed to work on Unix-like operating systems like Linux and macOS.
